## Core
Create a website about your favourite band using HTML (no css yet)
Elements that should be included:
    - A homepage, featuring photo of the band and a brief description (How they started, genre, controversy etc)
    - A discography page, showing their latest 3 studio albums in order of release, with an album cover and track listing
    - A bio page showing an unordered list of band members, with a photo, name, instrument for each
    - A navbar with links to the 3 pages
    - Heading on each page, telling the user which page they are on. Hompage should have title of the band
    - A footer with your copyright (make sure to use the symbol)
    - Throughout the site, try using HTML elements for effect! (e.g. <em> <b> etc)
